## About this project

The idea of the App is:

## Some notes about the project

1 - The [API](https://github.com/claudiobonfati/linkedin-redesign-api) is a sample API with static data for displaying purpose only. 

2 - The new redesign concept was created by [Gregoire Vella](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregoirevella/), and it's not intended to be shown as my personal work. See more at [Authors](#authors) section.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project in the development mode, you'll need to have a basic environment to run an React.js application, that can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

Also, you'll need the [API](https://github.com/claudiobonfati/linkedin-redesign-api) running locally on your machine. You can find the [API](https://github.com/claudiobonfati/linkedin-redesign-api) and all the instructions to start the local server [here](https://github.com/claudiobonfati/linkedin-redesign-api).

### Installing

**Cloning the repository**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/claudiobonfati/linkedin-redesign-concept.git

$ cd linkedin-redesign-concept
```

**Installing dependencies**

```
$ npm install
```

### Connecting the project with the local API

1 - Follow the instructions on the [API page](https://github.com/claudiobonfati/linkedin-redesign-api) to have the server up and running on your machine.

2 - With the API up and running, rename the [.env.example](https://github.com/claudiobonfati/linkedin-redesign-concept/blob/master/.env.example) file to `.env` and edit the NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL value to `http://localhost:3000/graphql`, or with the value you set up the API.

### Running

With all dependencies installed and the environment properly configured, you can now run the project:

```
$ npm run dev
```

Access the application at http://localhost:3001/linkedin-redesign-app/.
